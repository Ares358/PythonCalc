# PythonCalc

## Python Program to Make a Simple Calculator
> This is a basic example to demonstrate

In this example you will learn to create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply or divide depending upon the input from the user.

####To run simply use:
```sh
$> python Calc.py
```
## Description
In this program, we ask the user to choose an operation. Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are valid. If any other input is given, Invalid Input is displayed and the loop continues until a valid option is selected.

Two numbers are taken and an if...elif...else branching is used to execute a particular section. User-defined functions add(), subtract(), multiply() and divide() evaluate respective operations and display the output.
